This BibTeX style supports the `doi`, `url`, and `urldate` fields for every item type, and includes the item type `online`.  It requires the `natbib` package and produces citations in the Author (year) format.

It also requires the `hyperref` package, which defines`\url` and `\href`.

To change the word used for a url access date (as specified by the `urldate` field), redefine `\urlaccessed` in your document.  (For example, `\def\urlaccessed{visited on}`.)
